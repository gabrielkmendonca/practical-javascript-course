console.log(`Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:
            Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.
            Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.
            Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
            Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
            Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).`)

let size = fruits.length //returns the length (size) of an array
let myList = fruits.toString() //returns the elements of an array as a comma separated string
let fruit = fruits.at() //returns an indexed element from an array — same as "fruits.at[]"
fruits.join(" * ") //joins all array elements into a string, and in addition you can specify the separator
fruits.pop() //removes the last element from an array
let pop = fruits.pop() //returns the value that was "popped out"
fruits.push("Kiwi") //adds a new element to the end of a array
let push = fruits.push("Kiwi") //returns the new array length
fruits.shift() //removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index
let shift = fruits.shift() //returns the value that was "shifted out"
fruits.unshift("Lemon") //adds a new element to be beginning of the array, and "unshifts" older elements
let unshift = fruits.unshift("Lemon") //returns the new array length
fruits[fruits.length] = "Kiwi" //easy way to append a new element to an array
const myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys) //creates a new array by concatenating existing arrays — can also take strings as arguments
fruits.copyWithin(2, 0) //copies array elements to another position in an array — the first element is the one that is being overwritten, the second is the one being copied
const newArr = myArr.flat() //creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated to a specified depth
const flat = myArr.flatMap(x => [x, x * 10]); //maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi"); //first parameter defines where should be added, second parameter defines how many should be removed, and the other parameters are the elements that will be added
const spliced = fruits.toSpliced(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi") //the same as splice, but created a new array instead of modifying the existing one
const citrus = fruits.slice(1) //slices out a piece of an array into a new array — can take 2 arguments (starting and ending points)

let firstValue = numbers.find(x => x > 18) //returns the value of the first array element that satisfies a condition
let firstIndex = numbers.findIndex(x => x > 18) //returns the index of the first array element that satisfies a condition

const numbers3 = numbers.flatMap(x => x * 10) //maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array
const over18 = numbers.filter(x => x > 18) //creates a new array with array elements that pass a test
let allOver18 = numbers.every(x => x > 18) //checks if all array elements pass a test
let someOver18 = numbers.some(x => x > 18) //checks if soma array elements pass a test
Array.from(text) //creates an array objects from an iterable object or a object with a length property
const keys = numbers.keys() //returns an Array Iterator object with the keys of an array
const entry = fruits.entries() //create an Array Iterator, and then iterate over the key/value pairs
const myFruits = fruits.with(2, "Strawberry") //updates an array without altering the original, by creating a new array
const children = [...myGirls, ...myBoys] //used in order to join arrays — if only uses one array, it will be copied
