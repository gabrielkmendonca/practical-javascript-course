//Subtraction (-)
let sub = a - b

//Multiplication (*)

//Exponentiation (*)*

//Division (/)

//Division remainder (%)
let rem = a % b

//Increment
let y = 5

//Decrement
let z = 5

//Concatenate (+) - (when working with strings)

let concat = txt1 + '' + txt2 //concatenation joins strings

//Assignment operators (assigns values while operation occurs at the same time)
let x = 0
x += a // adds value to the variable
x -= a // substract value from the variable
x *= a // multiplies the value to the variable
x /= a // divides the variable by the value
x %= a // gets the division remainder of the variable by the value
x **= a // exponentiate the variable by the value

//Comparison
x == 5 //equal to
x === 5 //equal value and equal type 
x != 5 //not equal
x !== 5 //not equal value and not equal type
x > 5 //greater than
x < 5 //less than
x >= 5 //greater than or equal to
x <= 5 //less than or equal to
